# Snow Crash

## Summary
This project is an introduction to cyber security.

## Introduction
As a coder, I will most probable work in my career on some programs that will be used by hundreds of people. 
If my code has vulnerabilities, the people using it will also be vulnerable and exposed with a system that can be exploited. 
It is my responsibility to understand the techniques used to exploit these vulnerabilities so that I can detect and avoid them. 
This project is therefore a short introduction to the vast universe that is cyber security, where the right to error cannot exist.

### Objectives
Snow Crash will make me discover security in various sub-domains, with a developer-oriented approach. 
I will become familiar with several languages (ASM/perl/phpâ€¦), develop a certain logic to understand unknown programs, and become aware of problems linked to simple programming errors.
